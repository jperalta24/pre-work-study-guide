# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- I created this prework study guide webpage to help bootcamp students who are going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. Through the process of creating this webpage, I learned how to use Git for version control and the GitHub workflow.

## Usage

To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command=Option=I (MacOs) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
